# simplex-method-with-big-M-initialization
This project generates the initial simplex tableau for any linear programming problem, handling mixed constraints of any size. It applies the Big-M method for â‰¥ and = constraints, then implements the simplex algorithm integrating the Big-M variant for solving the problem.
